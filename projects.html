            CampusPath was a Google Maps like web application designed for the
            University of Texas at Tyler main campus. The idea was for users to
            be able to enter in a destination anywhere on campus and be directed
            to said
            destination using the paths and sidewalks throughout the campus.

              CampusPath was developed in a group of 6 people. My role in
              CampusPath was primarily as a backend developer as well as
              proposing the idea in the first place. Here I would assist in many
              of the necessary classes and algorithms needed for a mapping
              application to work. On top of the backend work I did I also
              helped in the development and creation of the database and even
              helped a bit on the frontend.
              <br><br>
              Along with the coding and implemtation of CampusPath, I also
              worked on the planning phases of development. This included
              creating the overall structure of the project and filling in the
              missing paths that we couldn't pull from OpenStreetMaps.
              <br><br>
              The development of CampusPath taught me many lessons about the
              creation of an application. It is one of the first major projects
              I have done and the first I have done with a proper team. It still
              stands as my favorite project so far.
