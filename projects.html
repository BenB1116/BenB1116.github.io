            CampusPath was a Google Maps like web application designed for the
            University of Texas at Tyler main campus. The idea was for users to
            be able to enter in a destination anywhere on campus and be directed
            to said
            destination using the paths and sidewalks throughout the campus.

              CampusPath was developed in a group of 5 people. My role in
              CampusPath was primarily as a backend developer. Here I

              neighbhor search. I would also assist in the implemtation of the
              database and the A* algorithm for shortest pathfinding. On top of
              this backend work I did assist in the constuction of some frontend
              elements such as the main menu and the map screen.
